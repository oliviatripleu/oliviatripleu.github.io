        # Unix Filters

## Filter

- program that transforms a byte stream
- commands that take in the standard input, perform a transformation, and writes the transformed bytes to std output
- most are line-based

## Using Filters

```python
$ <input.txt filter >output.txt

$ filter input1.txt input2.txt input3.txt >output.txt
```

- Filters used in combination are powerful (via a pipeline)
    
    ```python
    filter1 | filter2 | ... | filterN
    ```
    
- read from the file data1
    
    ```python
    filter data1
    
    OR
    
    filter < data1
    ```
    
- read from the files data1 data2 data3
    
    ```python
    filter data1 data2 data3
    ```
    
- read from data1, then stdin, then data2
    
    ```python
    filter data1 - data2
    ```
    

## Cat

- ******cat****** is the simplest filter
    - passes the byte stream unchanged
    - copies input to output unchanged
    - useful cat options
    
    | -n | number output lines |
    | --- | --- |
    | -A | display non-printing characters |
    | -s | squeeze consecutive blank lines into a single blank line |

## Regex

- regular expressions

| p* | 0 or more multiples of the previous char |
| --- | --- |
| a | b | a or b |
| (a | b) {4} | () for grouping, repeat it 4 times |
| \ * | removes any special meaning of the following character |
| . | any single character |
| [aeiou] | any single vowel |
| [^aeiou] | any single character that’s NOT a vowel |
| ^s | s must be at the start of the string |
| c$ | must end the string with c |
| p+ | 1 or more multiples of the previous char |
| p? | 0 or 1 multiples of the previous char |
| p{n} | n repetitions of p |
| p{n,m} | n to m repetitions of p |
| p{n,} | n or more repetitions of p |
| p{,m) | m or less repetitions of p |
| ^$ | anything that is an empty line |
| $’[ \t]$’ | tab at the end of the line |
| /s$ | string that end with whitespace |
| [LBHP] | L, B, H, or P |
| \w | something that is a word character |
| \W | something that is NOT a word character |
| ‘^[1-9=-0-9]*(,[1-9][0-9]*)+$’ | list of positive numbers |
| ‘”[^”]\n”’ |  |

## Using Grep

- prints the lines that contain the regex

```python
grep -E '(a|b){4}' dictionary.txt
```

| -i | ignore upper/lower-case difference in matching |
| --- | --- |
| -v  | only display lines that do not match the pattern |
| -c | print a count of matching lines |
| -w | only match pattern if it makes a complete word |

## Variations of grep

| grep -F | strings without regex |
| --- | --- |
| grep -G OR grep | like grep -E but without +?|(){} |
| grep -E | most commonly used, full POSIX regular expressions |
| grep -P | use if you need Perl/Python regex extensions |

## wc: word counter

- by default, wc prints the number of lines, words, characters in the input

| -c | print the number of characters |
| --- | --- |
| -w | print the number of words |
| -l | print the number of lines |

## tr: transliterate characters

| -c | map all bytes not occurring in sourceChars (complement) |
| --- | --- |
| -s | squeeze adjacent repeated characters out (only copy the first) |
| -d | delete all characters in sourceChars (no destChars) |

## head/ tail

| head | prints the first n lines of input |
| --- | --- |
| tail | prints the last n lines of input |

## cut

- prints selected parts of input lines

| -flistOfCols | print only the specified fields on output |
| --- | --- |
| -clistOfPos | print only chars in the specified positions |
| -dc | use character c as the field separator |

## sort

- copies input to output but ensures that the output is sorted
- by default, sorted by first character in the line

 

| -r | reverse sort |
| --- | --- |
| -n | sort numerically |
| -d  | dictionary order (ignore non-letters and non-digits |
| -tc | use character c to separate columns (default: space) |
| -kn | sort on column n |

## uniq

- by default, removes or counts (consecutive) duplicates

| -c | also print number of times each line is duplicated |
| --- | --- |
| -d | only print (one copy of ) duplicated lines) |
| -u | only print lines that occur uniquely (once) |
- `sort` and then `uniq` would remove all duplicates even if they’re not contiguous

## Using commands in combination

```python
cut -d\| -f1 enrollments.txt |sort|uniq -c|sort -n|tail -1

grep -E 'COMP2041.*F$' enrollments.txt | wc -1
```

## sed

- partition lines based on patterns rather than columns
- by default, prints out everything

**Options:**

| -n | do not print these lines by default |
| --- | --- |
| -E | extended regular expressions |

**Editing commands:**

| p | print the current line |
| --- | --- |
| d | delete the current line |
| s/regex/replace | subs first occurrence of string matching regex by “replace” string |
| s/regex/replace/g | subs all occurrences of string matching regex by “replace” string (adding a ‘g’ at the end makes it global) |
| q | terminate execution of sed |

```python
# prints line 7
sed -n '7p' data

#prints using regex
sed -n '/^(cs|en|bi|se)[0-9]{4}/p' data

#deletes everything between the line that starts with j and the line that starts with c
sed -E '/^j/,/^c/d' data
```

```python
grep -Ev '[^AB]|((BB).*(AA))' input.txt

# turns all uppercase letters into their lowercase equivalent
sed -E 's/[A-Z]/\L&/g' enrolments.psv
```

## delimiter

- character that separates columns in a file
- e.g. | or :
- if you’re using SPACE as a delimiter and you want the second field:
    - `tr -s " " | cut -d' ' -f3`
