        # Shell <br />
        - interprets commands <br />
        - bash <br />
        - most popular shell <br />
        ### Hash Bang (`#!`) <br />
        - start the shell script with a **shebang** line: <br />
        - `#!/bin/sh` - tells the operating system to get that program and use
        it to run the commands in this file <br />
        - saying it’s an interpreted language (in this case, shell) <br />
        ### POSIX-compliance shell: <br />
        - dash: `#!/bin/dash` <br />
        ## Shell script <br />
        - `ls` has lots of options: <br />
        - e.g. `ls -a -l -S` <br />
        - tedious to enter all the options every time <br />
        - write a **shell script** so that when you just run `myls` it will run
        all those options of `ls` <br />
        - `vi myls`: ```bash #!/bin/dash ls -laS "$@" ``` <br />
        - can drop it in a file, but then you can only run `./myls` if you’re in
        the same directory, or if you give it the path <br />
        - not convenient <br />
        - when you run `which date` <br />
        - it will give you the directory that the `date` command is in <br />
        - in shell scripts, you should put the long form for **options** <br />
        - for readability <br />
        - e.g. `--dereference-command-line` instead of `-H` <br />
        - use `#` for comments <br />
        ### $PATH <br>
        - when you run `echo $PATH` <br>
        - it will give you a list of
        directories that it could be in <br>
        - so when you run the command `date` it
        will check in each of the directories in the path, and if it’s any of
        them, it will run it for you <br>
        ### tr <br>
        - can be used to change spaces into
        newlines <br>
        - `tr ' ' '\n' <dracula.txt` <br>
            - change uppercase into lowercase
        <br>
        - `tr 'A-Z' 'a-z' <dracula.txt` <br>
        ### chmod <br>
        - `chmod u+x frequency.sh`
        gives you permission to execute the file <br>
        - `rwxr--r-x` <br>
        ## Single vs. Double Quotes <br>
        - `' '` groups the characters into a single word <br>
        - `" "`
        expands variables, commands, and arithmetic <br>
        ## Exit Status and Control 
        - shell scripts look at other programs’ exit status <br>
        - false = 1, true = 0
        <br>
        - `echo $?` gives you the exit status of the command you just ran <br>
        ### Using Exit Status for Conditional Execution <br>
        - commands separated by a
        `;` or newline <br>
        - all commands are executed <br>
        - `cmd1; cmd2; cmd3` -
        commands separated by `&&` <br>
        - execution stops if command has **non-zero**
        exit status <br>
        - `cmd1 && cmd2 && cmd3` <br>
        - commands separated by `||` -
        execution stops if a command has **zero** exit status <br>
        - `cmd1 || cmd2 ||
        cmd3` <br>
        - **`exit 1` (break)** <br>
        - if the first cmd
        doesn’t exit with `0`, break <br>
        ## Test `[]` and Arithmetic `$(())` <br>
        - `test
        -e` can be used to check if a file exists in the current directory -
        `-eq` equals <br>
        - `-lt` less than <br>
        - `!` not <br>
        - `$#` is number of command
        line arguments <br>
        - `$0` is program name <br>
        - `$a` is all the arguments -
        `1>&2` makes the error message go to `stderr` instead of `stdout` <br>
        ### Curl <br>
        - `curl` gives you the contents of a webpage <br>
        - e.g. `curl
        http://0.0.0.0:8000/` gives you `hello Andrew` <br>
        - `--silent` prevents it
        giving you a bunch of timing information <br>
        - e.g. `curl --silent https...
        2>/dev/null | grep "$regex"`<br>
        ## Temporary files
        - if you change a variable inside a pipeline, it won’t be changed outside the pipeline
        - `mktemp` to make a temporary file
        - use `trap 'rm -f $temporary_file' EXIT`
        - right after you make the temp file
        - to remove the temporary file when you exit, however the program exits
        ## Using here document
        - `<< marker` calls a here document
        - `marker` ends the here document
